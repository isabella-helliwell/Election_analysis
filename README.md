      1.5 The winning candidate and their votes and percentage vote
      Finally write the results into a text file 
## 2 Resources
      - Data source: elections_results.csv
      - Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code version 1.58
## 3 Analysis
      
      The analysis are carried out using the csv file provided with the election data,
      iterating the data and counting the county votes and the candidate votes and printing
      out the results and saving it to a text file.
      This is done using Python codes.
      The coding aspect of the analysis is divided into 3 main sections. All of which is shown in 
      Parts1, 2 and 3 of the analysis section.
      
### 3.1 Analysis-Part 1
